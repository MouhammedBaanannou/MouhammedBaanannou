Hey there! 👋
I'm Mohammed, a full-stack developer who builds fast, modern web applications.
I design and build whatever I can imagine. If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.
My main tech stack is React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Docker. My favorite tools are VS Code, Figma, and Postman.
I've got a bunch of pinned projects below, but my favorite is [Your Favorite Project].
I've built over 10 public repos (i will add them soon), but privately... it's probably way more at this point.
Fun Facts:

🏎️ Obsessed with cars and Formula 1
♟️ Chess enthusiast
👔 Fashion and style matter
🚀 If it can be built, I'll find a way
